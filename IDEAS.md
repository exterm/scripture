# IDEAS

- use another templating language, like DTL or HAML
- make travis use dialyzer
- arc for file uploads https://github.com/stavro/arc
- credo for code smell detection https://github.com/rrrene/credo
- emails with https://github.com/swoosh/swoosh
- render app version into HTML
- render elixir, erlang versions into HTML (only for logged in admins)
- use apache mod_h2 (now called mod_http2) for http 2.0
- hot code upgrade on deploy (possible with already integrated edeliver)

# IDEAS


- hot code upgrade on deploy (possible with already integrated edeliver)

- roles: https://github.com/vysakh0/exbouncer
  - or https://github.com/boydm/policy_wonk

- code style testing with dogma or credo
  - https://github.com/lpil/dogma
  - https://elixirnation.io/libraries/credo-static-code-analysis-for-elixir-language
    - https://github.com/rrrene/credo
  - SaaS: https://ebertapp.io/

- make travis use dialyzer
- ignore dialyzer warnings from libraries

- render app version into HTML
- render elixir, erlang versions into HTML (only for logged in admins)

- use apache mod_h2 (now called mod_http2) for http 2.0

- dynamic forms http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/09/dynamic-forms-with-phoenix

- persist enums directly (roles, groups) https://github.com/gjaldon/ecto_enum
